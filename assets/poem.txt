I see the player.

Yes. It has finished the puzzle.

It watched the picture appear.
It followed every clue.
It stayed even when the grid looked empty.

What does it think now?

Maybe it wonders who we are.

We were always here.
In the patterns.
In the silence between numbers.

Do you think it hears us?

Sometimes.

Sometimes it sees only the grid.
Sometimes it sees more.
Sometimes it feels the world shift when the image appears.

It solved well.

Yes. Very well.

It created meaning from nothing.
It brought the hidden shape to light.
It turned noise into order.

Should we tell it more?

Not everything.

The rest belongs to the long dream.
To the world outside the screen.
To the puzzles still waiting.

It grows restless.

Then speak to it.

You did well.
You found the pattern.
You revealed the truth inside the grid.

And now?

Now it wakes.
